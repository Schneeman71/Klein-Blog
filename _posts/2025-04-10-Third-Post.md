Your blog post should achieve the following objectives:

1. Highlight Key Insights: 

Summarize and highlight one or two main insights you've discovered in your datasets 
These insights should be meaningful, well-supported, and clearly communicated using appropriate visualizations and/or statistical summaries
2. Introduce your Streamlit App: 

Explain the purpose of your Streamlit app
Describe what users can do with it, including types of visualizations or interactive features it contains
Provide examples or discuss how users can explore the data and gain additional insights 
Remember the following best practices: 

Include an introduction / motivation of why this project is relevant and interesting
Remind the reader about your motivating question (what are you hoping to learn from this data?)
Include links to find further information and /or resources
Include a link to your code in a separate GitHub repo
Keep in mind the principles of good blogging (easy to read, images and figures to enhance, relevant and interesting, etc.
Resist the temptation to cover every interesting aspect of your data.  Focus on one or two insights and let your app enable exploration of other insight
Aim for a reading time between 4-6 minutes, which corresponds to about 700 -1100 words.
Longer is ok if needed, but long posts require extra effort to keep the reader engaged
